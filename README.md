Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied
Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row; or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript with jQuery (or vanilla DOM methods if you really prefer) for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)


## General description of the project:
* User can choose their own profile
* User can record how many rounds they play and how many times player one wins, player two wins and fair game
* User can play a next round and keep how many rounds they played
* User can start a whole new session with restart
* User can change the board to 3 * 3, 5 * 5 and 8 * 8 size
* User can play with computer
* computer can change the profile with the user choice


## Tech used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery



## HTML & CSS
* The corner of the 1st line: 
    Restart this round
    Restart whole game
    Choose the board size
* The 2nd line: Game Name at the very top
* The 3rd line: Set two players box and information
* Assign two players the symbol 
    (will upgrade like customize tokens, names, pictures in the next version) 
    1. there are html and graph
    2. hide html or display none for graph, and change the src of graph
    3. remember to change the js, where your decision is if there is html
   
* Set a box beside each player symbol, in the future who wins it will shows 'win' beside the player name 
    - win animation in the next version
* Set a box between two players, if neither wins, show a draw in the middle box
* The 4th line: select which profile
    - find some graphs to fill in
    - [ ] set hover effect when user place the mouse on profile
* The 5th line: Build a 3 * 3 game GUI
    - hover when press the key board
* The 6th line: shows multiple game rounds with a win counter (Next version)
* Larger Board (next version)
* do not rely on id, build a for loop with row and column in HTML (Next version)

## JS
* Reset Button to reset the whole game
* Default player one first
* Place player one symbol first then player two symbol in turn, switching symbol by clicking (on click)
1. set a variable, set as true first, when it is true, it means the first player.
    When place the key, check if that block have html or not.
2. build a 3 * 3 array, if the first player place the key, set the corresponding location in array to 1.
    2.1) 1st time thought: set each div id = x0y0 to x2y2 which the number is related to the label in the array I set. Then pick the id and change the string to number and use many if to put in the correspoding position
3. when click the div, give this div html, then change the variable to false, means the second player.
    When place the key, check if that block have html or not.
4. if the second player place its key, set the corresponding location in array to -1
5. To decide which side win:
    - 5.1) 1st time thought: enumeration method, list all the probabilities, and use if to decide. But not suitable for the larger board.
    - 5.2) 2nd time thought: divide into 4 situations:
    ```
    const board = [
                    c0, c1, c2
                r0  [0,  0,  0],
                r1  [0,  0,  0],
                r2  [0,  0,  0]
    ];
    ```
        on the board is board[r][c]

        a)horizontal: check c+1, if same, check c+2

                      c+1 same, c+2 not same, check c-1, first check c-1 >= 0

                      c+1 not same, check c-1,
                      if c-1 same, check c-2, first check c-2 >= 0 
        
        b) vertical:    r+1 to check if the bottom key is the same,
                        if r+1 same check if r+2 is the same,
                        if r, r+1, r+2 all the same then win

                        r+1 same, r+2 not same,
                        check if r-1 same, first check if r-1 >= 0
                        if r-1, r, r+1 all same then win

                        if r+1 not same, check r-1,
                        if r-1 same, check r-2, first check if r-2 >= 0

        c) right oblique: check c+1 & r-1, if same, check c+2 & r-2
                          
                          if c+1 & r-1 same, c+2 & r-2 not same,
                          check c-1 & r+1

                          if c+1 & r-1 not same, check c-1 & r+1,
                          if c-1 & r+1 same, check c-2 & r+2

        d) left oblique: check c+1 & r+1, if same, check c+2 & r+2

                         if c+1 & r+1 same, c+2 & r+2 not same,
                         check c-1 & r-1

                         if c+1 & r+1 not same, check c-1 & r-1,
                         if c-1 & r-1 same, check c-2 & r-2

    - 5.3) divide into 4 directions,
         every click will run the whole grid to catch if there is a winner,
         in each direction, run a big for loop, then run a small loop inside, for example

         a) horizontal: in each row, for loop the column, start from the first one, if the value is 1 or -1, make a new variable = 0, max length is 3, column + 1 total 3 times, to see if the sum is 3 or -3, if is 3 then p1 win, if is -3 then p2 win.
                    
6. Decide if the game is fair.
   If the board is full of keys and no 1 or -1 value in key. Then it's fair game


* cannot click the same place twice (true of false?)

* When one win, there is something beside, start from a YOU WIN logo (Animation in the next version)
* Three in a line then one win
* Player One can choose its symbol (Next version)
* Larger Board (next version)
* - [ ] change the rule of winning with different board
* AI
    * random AI
    * first priority is the center of the board
    * try to block the user

    * player one is human, player two is computer
        1. human click the key on board, then computer automatically place the key
        2. use random and floor to make two int numbers from 0 to 2 
        3. give the number to row and column in data to find that specific div use each iterate
        4. after find that div, write html to it 
        5. isFistPlayer always true
        6. don't let the computer to place the key which have value


## In version 2
* build a 3 * 3 board with JavaScript (then 5 * 5)
* use the nested for loop to create rows and columns
* create 3 row divs for putting the unit
write the rows and columns info in data-row and data-column use .append()
put same row different columns into a row div
* write CSS to make the board

## Still need to work on:
- [ ] computer side smarter, like put keys in the center, then block the user
- [ ] make winning keys different, now the diagonal have some issues with more winning keys
- [ ] add a dropdown bar user can choose how many keys winning
- [ ] do more css and html decorations
